### Overview
This project was developed as part of the Programming in Graphical Environments course.
Its goal was to help students become familiar with the WPF framework and client–server communication concepts.

The application consists of two independent components — a Client and a Server — which must be run separately.
Successful login requires the client’s credentials to exactly match those configured in the admin’s GUI.
(This mechanism is planned to be replaced by a proper database-backed authentication system in future updates.)

The application implements a group chat system built on top of the TCP/IP protocol.
